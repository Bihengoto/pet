      Playing with your cat is a wonderful bonding experience.
      Cats love to play and are experts in inventing their own games.
      Before you invest in expensive cat toys, experiment with things found around the house.
      Paper bags are great fun, as are cardboard boxes.
      Jaspurr, pictured here loves to play "box sled" and will let Lance drag him around the floor for hours.
      As you can see, he is very serious about his play.

      The diet a cat gets early in life will set the pace for his lifelong health and well-being.
      Your knowledge of cat food ingredients will help ensure not only longevity but the quality
      of life you want for your new family member.
      Although cats descend from desert creatures, fresh water is also essential to them, especially if they
      eat a dry food diet.

      Although this class is presented in one lesson, the content is something you should review for weeks
      and months ahead, until you feel secure in your knowledge. Once you learn to read cat food labels it will
      become a habit for life. A source of clean, fresh water is also vital to your cat's well-being. Although
      cats have descended from desert animals, they still need to be well-hydrated.
